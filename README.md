The first thing that comes to my mind about computers is the Sokoban game, my favorite one when I was 6 years old. I love the process of thinking and trying different paths, and will gain an unspeakable sense of achievement after figuring out each puzzle. As I went through middle school and high school, I was impressed by the huge sea of games and software invented by software engineers and innovative companies. We can make animations using Flash, design our website, chat with friends outside of school using social apps, etc.

The passion carried me through my education at Xidian Unversity and then Duke. The abundant resources at those two schools help me make a progress in Game Design and Software development. I studied computer languages, principles of computer composition, operating systems, database systems, data structures and algorithms, which all make me much closer to what I want to be: A Software Engineer.

Being a Software Engineer, for me, is like a journey solving no-ending puzzles. And I enjoy the journey because I love coding, thinking, and proposing innovative ideas.
